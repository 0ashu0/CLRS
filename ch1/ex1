Grading system needs the sorting.

1.1-2
Scalability,correctness

1.1-3
array,whose size must be fixed when define it, but quite handy to use.

1.1-4
Both are looking the best path for the lowest cost. However, the destination and the source are different for the shortest-path probelem, where they are the same in the travelling-salesman problem

1.1-5
Scarces resources allocation always looks for the best option. A student grading system can accept sorting algorithms that are not the fastest one.

Image processing.It need all kinds of algorithms such as thresholding, learning and so on.

1.2-2
Based on the problem, an equation was obtained as:
	8n^2 = 64nlgn
which could be simplified as:
	   n = 8lgn
where n belongs to the region (2,3).
Hence for value 1,2 insertion sort beat merge sort.

1.2-3
An equation was obtained as:
	100n^2 < 2^n
Hence the smallest value is 15.

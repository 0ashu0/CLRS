 * The pseudocode FIND-MAX-CROSSING-SUBARRAY didn't show how to initialize variables `max-left` and `max-right`, so technically it's imporssible to determine what can return for such case. For real implementation, however, FIND-MAXIMUM-SUBARRAY is supposed to return the single greatest item in the all-negative array.

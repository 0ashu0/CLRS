		Chapter 10 Elementary Data Structures

10.1 Stacks and queues

ex 10.1-4	:	queue.hpp
Rewrite ENQUEUE and DEQUEUE to detect underflow and overflow of a queue.

ex 10.1-5	:	deque.hpp
Whereas a stack allows insertion and deletion of elements at only one end, and a 
queue allows insertion at one end and deletion at the other end, a deque (double-
ended queue) allows insertion and deletion at both ends. Write four O(1) time 
procedures to insert elements into and delete elements from both ends of a deque 
implemented by an array.

ex 10.1-6	:	queue_by_2stacks.hpp
Show how to implement a queue using two stacks. Analyze the running time of the
queue operations.

ex 10.1-7	:	stack_by_2queues.hpp
Show how to implement a stack using two queues. Analyze the running time of the
stack operations.

Chapter 10

ex 10.1-4
Rewrite ENQUEUE and DEQUEUE to detect underflow and overflow of a queue.

	ch10/queue.hpp


ex 10.1-5
Whereas a stack allows insertion and deletion of elements at only one end, and a 
queue allows insertion at one end and deletion at the other end, a deque (double-
ended queue) allows insertion and deletion at both ends. Write four O(1) time 
procedures to insert elements into and delete elements from both ends of a deque 
implemented by an array.

	deque.hpp


ex 10.1-6
Show how to implement a queue using two stacks. Analyze the running time of the
queue operations.

	queue_by_2stacks.hpp
